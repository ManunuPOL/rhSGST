# rhSGST
A script that adds some cool features to SteamGifts and SteamTrades.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

## Installation

To install the script, you must install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) first. Then [click here](https://github.com/revilheart/rhSGST/raw/master/rhSGST.user.js) and you should be prompted to install it.

## Compatibility

Fully tested and working in the latest version of:

* Google Chrome (Tampermonkey)

Should be working in the latest version of:

* Firefox (Greasemonkey & Tampermonkey)
* Opera (Tampermonkey)

Tested on Microsoft Edge and most of it seems to work fine, but for some reason requests made from `https://www.steamgifts.com/account` redirect to `https://www.steamgifts.com`. I haven't been able to figure out why yet, so avoid Edge for now.

### Settings Menu

`steamgifts.com/account/*`

* Allows you to enable / disable features.
* Allows you import / export your data.
* Allows you to manage `Whitelist / Blacklist Highlighter` and `Not Activated / Multiple Wins Checker` caches.
* Allows you to sync your data and enable / disable the automatic sync.

### Fixed Elements

`(steamgifts|steamtrades).com/*`

* Allows you to fix the header, heading, sidebar and footer, so that they scroll together with the page.
* You can disable any of the elements through the settings menu.
* In case it isn't clear, this is the heading:

![](http://i.imgur.com/6Hk0nus.png)

### Endless Scrolling

`(steamgifts|steamtrades).com/*`

![](http://i.imgur.com/sCJ97Dk.png)

* Allows you to endlessly scroll through pages.
* You can choose in which pages you want to enable the endless scrolling from the settings menu.
* If you click on the link to a page and that page is currently loaded, it will jump to the page instead of loading it. This only works on SteamGifts though, and if you jump between pages that aren't next to each other, the pagination gets messed up, but you can fix it by then going to the immediate previous / next page and returning.
* You can refresh pages without leaving the page.
* You can pause / resume the endless scrolling.
* You can enable reverse scrolling for discussions.

### SteamGifts Profile Button

`steamtrades.com/user/*`

![](http://i.imgur.com/k4P3OMy.png)

* Adds a button that links to an user's SteamGifts profile.

### SteamTrades Profile Button

`steamgifts.com/user/*`

![](http://i.imgur.com/iJxVz6D.png)

* Adds a button that links to an user's SteamTrades profile.

### Comment History

`steamgifts.com/*`

![](http://i.imgur.com/lDSXYcS.png)

* Keeps track of the comments you make (they can be seen from the settings menu).
* This feature **only** works with Main Comment Box Popup, Discussion Edit Detector and Multi-Reply / Reply From Inbox. If you submit a comment though SG's native comment box, the comment will not be tracked.

### Username History

`steamgifts.com/user/*`

![](http://i.imgur.com/cTnt7sk.png)

* Keeps track of usernames from the [database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rZQuo6T02zutwSo1edbDzW8q9GmpDIbaVvKN79TyFqA/edit?usp=sharing) and detects username changes every month.
* There are currently 7200+ users being tracked.
* An user is added to the database when you click on the arrow next to their username.
* You can view recent username changes from the settings menu.

### Permanent User Notes

`(steamgifts|steamtrades).com/user/*`

![](http://i.imgur.com/lF9YKjm.png)
![](http://i.imgur.com/1AvN0Co.png)

* Allows you to add notes to users.
* The notes are permanent because they are tied to an user's SteamID64 instead of their username.
* The icon changes if the notes are not empty:

![](http://i.imgur.com/PYm3Ds7.png)

### Permanent User Tags

`(steamgifts|steamtrades).com/*`

![](http://i.imgur.com/AIPs4d1.png)
![](http://i.imgur.com/4660IaT.png)

* Allows you to add tags to users.
* Unlike the permanent user notes, the tags are not tied to an user's SteamID64, because that information is only available in the profile page, but they are still permament because upon adding a tag to an user, it automatically detects username changes and returns any old tags you might have saved for that user before they changed their username.
* While the tags are not tied to an user's SteamID64, it still has to retrieve the user's profile page in order to save to the storage, so if you're adding tags to an user for the first time, it might take a while to do so.
* Separation of tags is purely cosmetic.

### Multi-Tag

`(steamgifts|steamtrades).com/*`

![](http://i.imgur.com/aZRQkxr.png)
![](blob:http://imgur.com/cadb3ff3-9f94-41ab-a302-d3ce73ea712e)

* Allows you to tag multiple users / games at the same time.
* It goes without saying that this feature only works if either Permanent User Notes or Game Tags are enabled.

### Whitelist / Blacklist Highlighter

`(steamgifts|steamtrades).com/*`

![](http://i.imgur.com/rxqGu9i.png)
![](http://i.imgur.com/mRIrwb7.png)

* Adds a heart or ban icon next to the username of all users from your whitelist / blacklist.
* The users must be scanned through the settings menu for the feature to work. You can scan them manually or enable the automatic scan to run every once in a while.

### Whitelist / Blacklist Checker

`steamgifts.com/*`

![](http://i.imgur.com/KDAHDme.png)
![](http://i.imgur.com/x6AWyp7.png)

* Allows you to check if an user or a list of users have whitelisted / blacklisted you.
* Results are cached for 24 hours.
* The caches can be seen and updated from the settings menu.
* The checker has a simplified version that only checks / shows whitelists. It can be activated from the settings menu by enabling `Show blacklist information.`. If this version is activated and the checker finds an user that has blacklisted you, it will return `There is not enough information to know if you are whitelisted or blacklisted.` instead of `You are blacklisted.`.
* You can highlight users who have whitelisted / blacklisted you by enabling this option through the settings menu. This functionality is supported on SteamTrades (`steamtrades.com/*`). The following icons will be added next to their username:

![](http://i.imgur.com/yPoDrnm.png)

* Allows you to check if an user or a page of winners from a giveaway have any not activated / multiple wins.
* Results are cached for 7 days.
* The caches can be seen from the settings menu (updating all of them at once is not possible).
* You can highlight users who have not received / multiple wins by enabling this option through the settings menu. This functionality is supported on SteamTrades (`steamtrades.com/*`). Their username will change to the following colors:

![](http://i.imgur.com/6Oo1Bkg.png)

### Not Received Finder

### Other Info

* All requests from `Whitelist / Blacklist Checker`, `Not Activated / Multiple Wins Checker`, `Not Received Finder` and `Archive Searcher` are limited to 2 per second, to prevent a stress on the SG servers.
* If you try to leave the page while `Whitelist / Blacklist Checker`, `Not Activated / Multiple Wins Checker`, `Not Received Finder` and `Archive Searcher` are running, you will get a confirmation dialog asking you if you want to leave the page. Additionally, while these features are running, their buttons are faded out.
* `Whitelist / Blacklist Checker`, `Not Activated / Multiple Wins Checker`, `Not Received Finder` and `Archive Searcher` allow for real-time options. For example, if you start `Whitelist / Blacklist Checker` with `Also check for whitelist.` enabled, but in the middle of the process you decide to disable that option, from that point onwards it will no longer check for whitelist.
